A user manual can be found in docs/source/;

Prerequisites
*************

The following packages are required to build and use the client library, and
can probably be had from your favorite package manager:

* gsl (>= 1.14): http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
* hdf5 with c++ bindings
* C++ compiler with C++11 support: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
* SQUIDS (>= 1.00): https://github.com/jsalvado/SQuIDS/

PythonToolBox
*************

Additionally for compiling and using the python bindings:

-Required:
* boost python: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/python/doc
* boost numpy: https://github.com/ndarray/Boost.NumPy
* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/

Modified the make file and compaile the directory
found in
